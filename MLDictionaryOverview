This file contains basic definitions to reference back to for ML, AI and the data analysis that comes with it. these definitions are my human, less boring take
on how to explain these concepts.


Machine learning - using a computer or machine to just do fancy math to help predict patterns that may or may not be useful given a data set to run the fancy math on.

AI - the perception of a machine (computer) being able to perform tasks that normally require human intervention using fancy math and assigning the machine ordered
tasks. (sorry to burst your bubble, but it's not as complicated as you think. Although it's still pretty awesome.)


supervised learning - using existing data with input and outputs(corret answers) to predict future outputs.
This can also be classified into 2 categories:
    Classification - where your data is seperated into 2 or more classes and you are trying to sort
    your inputs into however many classes you have. 
    EX: does my freind X have a dog, a cat, or neither? 
    we would use the classes 'has_a_dog', 'has a cat', and 'i_have_a_sad_lonely_friend'
    to classify what friend has what type of pet.
    
    regression - use this when the desired outputs(correct answers) are "continuous"
    EX: prediction of somones index finger length based on their height and weight.
    EX: prediction of someones savings account based on how many kids they have and what age they are.
    
unsupervised learning - using data that contains only inputs with no outputs(correct answers), and trying to lump
data points together using patterns and proximity to make up your own answers and conclusions.
EX: you own amazon and want to findout what customers made similar product purchases. you would assign customers
to different clusters(a "label" you put on data), and accidentally find out that you found a cluster of customers
that don't love their mothers becaus ethey didnt't buy mothers day gifts with their amazon purchases.
